# Polaris v2.0 # 
Polaris 2.0 is a full system that represents a self-directed project cycle as well as the knowledge 
representation of a student at a particular level. The system keeps track of students' knowledge representation
over time and allows mentors to change these representations.

## Running the code ##
1. git clone this repo
2. Run `meteor npm install` to get all the node packages
3. Run `meteor` to start the app

## Current status ##
Currently the application has routing completed as well as most of the user profile. We have added a basic knowledge 
representation as well. We hope to build this system out all the way with more research.
